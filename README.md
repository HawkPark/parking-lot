Hawk Park is a campus parking availability mobile app. Tagged as ‘your campus parking valet’, Hawk Park aims to make the Montclair State University campus parking experience quick, efficient and hassle-free. It will have the following features  Real time Parking updates: Commuters update parking space availability in the lots they are at to give real time feedback.  Parking Spot Guarantee: Connects would be ‘parkers’ to those who wish to leave campus, offering a ride to the parking lot in-exchange for their parking spot.  ‘where did I park?’ feature which helps to locate a parked vehicle. Membership will be restricted to students of Montclair State University. Only members would be allowed to update parking lot status and ‘ride to park’ features.
